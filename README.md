  A Vue app to show github's information of a searched user.
</center>

<br>

# 👀 About this Project
The idea of the App is help you to get the information about an user of github.

To get user data I used the Github API with two endpoints:
- https://api.github.com/users/[USERNAME]
- https://api.github.com/users/[USERNAME]/repos

<br>

# 🤔 Why?
This project was made by me to study and practice VueJS concepts when I was starting my first job.

Also, this project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer.
